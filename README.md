# Classification
Classification is a form of supervised learning that bears a lot in common with regression techniques. If machine learning is all about predicting values or names to things  by using datasets, then classification generally falls into two groups: binary classification and multiclass classification.

Before starting the process of cleaning our data, visualizing it, and prepping it for our ML tasks, let's learn a bit about the various ways machine learning can be leveraged to classify data.

Derived from statistics, classification using classic machine learning uses features, such as smoker, weight, and age to determine likelihood of developing X disease. As a supervised learning technique similar to the regression exercises you performed earlier, your data is labeled and the ML algorithms use those labels to classify and predict classes (or 'features') of a dataset and assign them to a group or outcome.
